**Supplementary Figure 5:** 
Chromosome-wide profiles of replication timing and repair. 
Replication timing profiles are shown for chromosome 1 and 19 until 50 Mb. 
Profiles are colored by the local ratio of **(A)** normalized repair rate and 
**(B)** Early/Late S phase normalized repair rate of CPD 12 minutes samples.
