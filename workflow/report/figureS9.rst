**Supplementary Figure 9:** 
Strand asymmetry of damage and repair around initiation zones 
in ERDs and LRDs due to sequence context. 
**(A)** Damage and **(B)** repair profiles of real and simulated reads around 
initiation zones for CPDs at 0 minutes (for damage), 
12 minutes (for repair), and 2 hours (for both damage and repair). 
Replicate A and B are combined.
