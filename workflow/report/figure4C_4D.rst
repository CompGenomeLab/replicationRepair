**Figure 4:** Repair rate and sequence context asymmetry around initiation zones in ERDs and LRDs. 
**(C-D)** (Left) CPD normalized repair rates [log2 (XR seqreal/simulation/Damage-seqreal/simulation)] at 12 minutes 
**(C)**, and 2 hours **(D)** in late S phase around initiation zones that were separated 
into corresponding replication domains. (Right) The boxplot of windows in left replicating and 
right replicating directions are shown separately for plus and minus strands. 
Paired wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences between the strands. 
Number of initiation zones in ERDs: 2190; in LRDs: 1448. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
