**Figure 4:** Repair rate and sequence context asymmetry around initiation zones 
in ERDs and LRDs. 
**(C-D)** (Left) CPD normalized repair rates 
[log2 (XR-seq\ :sub:`real/simulation`\/Damage-seq\ :sub:`real/simulation`\)] 
at 12 minutes **(C)**, and 2 hours **(D)** in late S phase around initiation 
zones that were separated into corresponding replication domains. 
(Right) The boxplot of windows in left replicating and 
right replicating directions are shown separately for plus and minus strands. 
Paired wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences 
between the strands. 
Number of initiation zones in ERDs: 2130; in LRDs: 1450. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
