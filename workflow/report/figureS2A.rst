**Supplementary Figure 2:** Edu-seq data and generated replication domains 
are similar to the Repli-seq and their replication domains.

coefficient between UV-treated/untreated early and late S phased EdU-seq 
samples (2 replicates for each) and G1b, S (1-4), G2 phases of 
public HeLa-S3 Repli-seq data.
