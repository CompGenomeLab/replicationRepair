**Figure 5:** Melanoma mutation asymmetry around common replication initiation zones. 
**(B)** Boxplots of HeLa initiation zonesâ€™ scores that are common in all 3 cell lines (overlapping) and 
the ones that are unique to HeLa cells (no overlap). 
The wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of difference. 
**(C)** Common initiation zones (20 kb long in 200 windows) were separated 
into quartiles based on their scores (OK-seq slope values) for each replication domain, 
and absolute mutation count difference between strands were calculated. 
Quartiles 1 and 4 correspond to the lowest and highest initiation zone scores, respectively. 
**(D)** (Left) Normalized TC>TT and CC>CT mutations (MC: mutation per [TC]C per region) around 
initiation zones that were separated into corresponding replication domains. 
(Right) The boxplot of windows in left and right replicating directions are shown separately 
for plus and minus strands. 
Paired wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences between the strands. 
Only mutations in intergenic regions were considered. 
Raw MC: not normalized mutation counts; MCp: mutation counts of plus strand; 
MCm: mutation counts of minus strand.
