**Figure 2:** The shift of repair rates with replication timing. 
**(A)** normalized Repair rates [log2 (XR-seqreal/simulation/Damage-seqreal/simulation)] 
of (6-4)PPs (Top) and CPDs (Bottom) around the center of ERDs (left, n = 121) and LRDs (right, n = 242). 
Dashed lines were the plus strands and straight lines were the minus strands. 
**(B)** Boxplot of normalized repair rates of (6-4)PPs and 
CPDs for both ERDs (left, n = 261) and LRDs (right, n= 535). 
The wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences between early and late S phases. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
