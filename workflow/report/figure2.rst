**Figure 2:** The shift of repair rates with replication timing. 
**(A)** normalized Repair rates 
[log2 (XR-seq\ :sub:`real/simulation`\/Damage-seq\ :sub:`real/simulation`\)] 
of (6-4)PPs (Top) and CPDs (Bottom) around the center of ERDs (left, n = 118) 
and LRDs (right, n = 237). 
Dashed lines were the plus strands and straight lines were the minus strands. 
**(B)** Boxplot of normalized repair rates of (6-4)PPs and 
CPDs for both ERDs (left, n = 266) and LRDs (right, n= 541). 
The wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences 
between early and late S phases. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
