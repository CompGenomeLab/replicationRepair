**Supplementary Figure 8:** 
Log2 transformed odds ratio of ERDs versus LRDs for better repair in 
early S phase than late S phase in each chromatin states. 
Horizontal lines show the lower and upper confidence intervals of odds ratios 
and Breslow-Day test (with Tarone correction) was used to indicate the 
difference of odds ratios between the chromatin states.
