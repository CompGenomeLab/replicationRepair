**Supplementary Figure 8:** Repair rate asymmetry around initiation zones and replication domains. 
(Left) (6-4)PP normalized repair rates [log2 (XR-seqreal/simulation/Damage-seqreal/simulation)] 
at 12 minutes in early **(A)** and late **(B)** S phases around initiation zones that were separated into 
corresponding replication domains. 
(Right) The boxplot of windows in left replicating and right replicating directions are shown 
separately for plus and minus strands. 
Paired wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences between the strands. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
