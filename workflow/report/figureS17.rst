**Supplementary Figure 17:** 
Asymmetric nucleotide content around initiation zones and replication domains. 
The percentage of each nucleotide at initiation zones in ERDs (Top) and 
LRDs (Bottom) was calculated separately for plus (blue) and minus (red) strands. 
Only a single sequence of a complementary pair was used. 
Sequences ordered based on the percentage differences between strands 
(top sequence having the highest difference while the bottom has the least.).
