**Supplementary Figure 7:** 
**(A)** Boxplot of normalized repair rates of CPDs at 12 minutes after UV at 
early and late S phases for each chromatin state. 
**(B)** Relative difference of early S phase and late S phase repair rates 
([log2(RR\ :sub:`Early S Phase`\/RR\ :sub:`Late S Phase`\)] used for ERDs; 
[log2(RR\ :sub:`Late S Phase`\/RR\ :sub:`Early S Phase`\)] used for LRDs) 
for each chromatin state. 
The wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences 
between ERDs and LRDs. 
Straight lines were ERDs, and dashed lines were LRDs. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
