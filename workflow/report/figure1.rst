**Figure 1:** Damage and repair maps of UV-irradiated synchronized HeLa cells. 
**(A)** Schematic of experiment design. HeLa cells were synchronized 
and exposed to 20J/m\ :sup:`2` \ UVC. 
Immediately or 12 minutes after UV irradiation, 
they were collected to perform Damage-seq or XR-seq, respectively. 
**(B)** Distribution of oligomer length of XR-seq reads of (6-4)PPs and CPDs 
in late S phase. 
**(C)** Dipyrimidine content of 26-nucleotide-long XR-seq and 
10 nucleotides around the first nucleotide of Damage-seq reads of (6-4)PPs and 
CPDs in late S phase. 
Because the DNA polymerase stops right before adducts during Damage-seq, 
the expected damage sites should be at -1 position. 
**(D)** Repair rates [log2 (XR-seq/Damage-seq)] of template strands (TS) and 
non-template strands (NTS) around transcription start sites (TSS) and end 
sites (TES). 
**(B-C)** Replicate A is shown. 
**(D)** Replicate A and B are combined.
