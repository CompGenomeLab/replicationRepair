**Figure 4:** Repair rate and sequence context asymmetry around initiation zones 
in ERDs and LRDs. 
**(F)** Correlation of relative occurrence of all mono- to penta-nucleotide 
sequences on the lagging and leading strand and the number of net TTs (TT-AA) 
for each sequence. 
Each dot represents a sequence, and the red bar represents the median of the 
Lagging/Leading strand values for each net TT value.
