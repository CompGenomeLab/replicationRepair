**Figure 3:** The effect of chromatin states along with replication timing on 
repair. 
**(A)** Boxplot of normalized repair rates 
[log2(XR-seq\ :sub:`real/simulation`\/Damage-seq\ :sub:`real/simulation`\)] 
of CPDs at 12 minutes after UV at early and late S phases 
for each chromatin state. 
**(B)** Relative difference of early S phase and late S phase repair rates 
[log2(RR\ :sub:`Early S Phase`\/RR\ :sub:`Late S Phase`\)] 
for each chromatin state. 
The wilcoxon test was used to assess the significance of differences between 
[log2(RR\ :sub:`Early S Phase`\/RR\ :sub:`Late S Phase`\)] and 0. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
