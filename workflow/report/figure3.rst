**Figure 3:** The effect of chromatin states along with replication timing on repair. 
**(A)** Boxplot of normalized repair rates [log2(XR-seqreal/simulation/Damage-seqreal/simulation)] 
of CPDs at 12 minutes after UV at early and late S phases for each chromatin state. 
**(B)** Relative difference of early S phase and late S phase repair rates 
[log2(RREarly S Phase/RRLate S Phase)] for each chromatin state. The wilcoxon test 
was used to assess the significance of differences between [log2(RREarly S Phase/RRLate S Phase)] and 0. 
Replicate A and B are combined.
