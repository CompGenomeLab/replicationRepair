**Figure 4:** Repair rate and sequence context asymmetry around initiation zones in ERDs and LRDs. 
**(E)** Correlation of relative occurrence of all mono- to penta-nucleotide sequences on the 
lagging and leading strand and the number of net Ts (T-A) for each sequence. 
Each dot represents a sequence, and the red bar represents the median of the 
Lagging/Leading strand values for each net T value.
