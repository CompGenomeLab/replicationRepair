## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Maintaining genome integrity is crucial for healthy cells to avoid cancer. 
Considering that DNA damages occur approximately 70,000 times per cell per day, 
repair of these damages is vital for the maintenance of genome stability [@tag:dnaDamage]. 
On the other hand, replication is the mechanism that causes unrepaired DNA damages to turn into mutations that might lead to cancer. 
The role of replication on DNA repair in general is yet to be clarified. 
Recently developed methods Damage-seq and XR-seq map damage formation and nucleotide excision repair events respectively, in various conditions [@tag:UVdamageRepair]. 
In this study, we analyze the Damage-seq and XR-seq results of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts) [(6-4)PPs] 
from UV-irradiated HeLa cells synchronized at two stages of the cell cycle: early S phase, and late S phase. 
We compare these datasets with the localized replication domains of HeLa cells [@tag:repDomain]. 
We aim to reveal how replication domains are influencing the repair preferences. 
We found out that in both early and late S phased cells, early replicating domains are more efficiently repaired relative to late replicating domains. 
We aim to investigate a potential differential repair efficiency between leading and lagging strand.
