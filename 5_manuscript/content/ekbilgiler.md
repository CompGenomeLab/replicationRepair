Genetic variation in exonic regions is lower than in intronic ones
both across species and within populations. This differential exon–
intron variation rate is attributed to the action of stronger purifying
selection on exonic nucleotide changes, whereas the rate of genera-
tion of variants—which precedes the effect of selection—is gener-
ally assumed to be overall homogeneous between these two genic
regions. This assumption lies at the heart of evolutionary biology
and cancer genomics approaches that compare the rates of intronic
and exonic variation to estimate the strength of selection acting on
coding genes 1–5 .
Recent studies have shown that the rate of mutations across
genomic regions is highly heterogeneous. Replication timing 6,7 , the
level of gene expression 8 and the degree of chromatin compaction 9,10
have been described as features that affect mutation rate at the mega-
base scale. Our group and others recently demonstrated that the local
efficiency of DNA repair is influenced by factors that affect accessibil-
ity of the repair machinery 11–14 .

We next focused on signatures that have not previously
been reported to be connected to replication, or for which
the causal mechanism is unknown. Our data show a link
between DNA replication and exogenous mutagens such
as UV light (signature 7), tobacco smoke (signature 4), or
aristolochic acid (AA; signature 22) [29]. In these signa-
tures, we observed marked correlation with replication
timing (Fig. 4, Additional file 2: Figures S19 and S20).
Higher mutation frequency late in replication has been
observed in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) treated
with AA or Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P; a mutagen in tobacco
smoke) [30]. This increased mutagenicity might be attrib-
uted to different DNA damage tolerance pathways being
